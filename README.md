# Bulletin Board

Bulletin Board is a marketplace akin to Avito, enabling users to create listings, interact with them, and engage with sellers. All listings are subject to review by service administrators prior to being made public. Administrators have the authority to request revisions, approve for publication, or archive listings.

Check out the [Live demo](https://d-it-bulletin-board.onrender.com) to explore the features of Bulletin Board.
